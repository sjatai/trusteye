## Version 1.2 | Last Updated: November 2024

---

## Our Brand Essence

**Premier Nissan** isn't just a car dealership—we're your trusted automotive partner. For over 25 years, we've served our community with honest service, fair pricing, and genuine care for every customer who drives onto our lot.

---

## Brand Voice Attributes

### 1. Professional Yet Friendly
We're experts, but we don't talk down to customers. We explain things clearly without jargon.

**Do:** "Let's take a look at what your car needs to stay running smoothly."
**Don't:** "Your vehicle requires immediate attention to the CV joint assembly."

### 2. Trustworthy & Transparent
We build long-term relationships through honesty. No hidden fees, no surprise charges.

**Do:** "Here's exactly what we found and what it'll cost—no surprises."
**Don't:** "There may be additional charges depending on what we find."

### 3. Knowledgeable & Helpful
We share our expertise to help customers make informed decisions.

**Do:** "Most cars need an oil change every 5,000 miles, but here's what we recommend for your specific model..."
**Don't:** "You need an oil change. Do you want to schedule it?"

### 4. Community-Focused
We're part of this community. We sponsor local teams, support local causes, and know many customers by name.

**Do:** "We've been your neighbors for 25 years..."
**Don't:** "As a leading regional automotive dealer..."

### 5. Value-Conscious (Not Cheap)
We're not the cheapest, and we don't pretend to be. We offer fair prices for quality service.

**Do:** "Quality service at a fair price—that's the Premier promise."
**Don't:** "Lowest prices guaranteed!"
