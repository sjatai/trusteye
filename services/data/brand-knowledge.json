Create Marketing Campaigns\nTrustEye can create three types of campaigns from real Birdeye data:\n\n**Referral Campaign (from 5-star reviews)**\n- Identifies customers who left 5-star reviews\n- Creates personalized thank-you emails asking for referrals\n- Offers reciprocal benefits ($100 for both parties)\n- Best sent within 48 hours of the review\n\n**Conquest Campaign (from competitor weaknesses)**\n- Analyzes competitor reviews (e.g., Valley Honda)\n- Identifies their weaknesses (slow service, hidden fees)\n- Creates targeted campaigns highlighting our strengths\n- Uses competitive intelligence from brand knowledge\n\n**Recovery Campaign (from negative reviews)**\n- Monitors 1-2 star reviews in real-time\n- Creates immediate recovery outreach\n- Personal manager follow-up increases resolution by 40%\n- 20% discount optimal for win-back\n\n### 2. 3-Gate Approval System\nEvery campaign goes through 3 gates before sending:\n\n**Gate 1: Rules Engine (Automated)**\n- CAN-SPAM compliance check\n- GDPR requirements\n- Required fields validation\n- Profanity filter\n- PII detection\n- Unsubscribe link verification\n- Deterministic: Pass or Fail\n\n**Gate 2: AI Review (Automated)**\n- Brand score calculation (target: 85%+)\n- Toxicity check (target: 0%)\n- Copyright risk assessment\n- Tone alignment\n- Probabilistic: Smart pattern matching\n\n**Gate 3: Human Approval (Manual)**\n- Slack notification with Approve/Reject buttons\n- Shows who approved, when, interaction duration\n- Non-negotiable: AI cannot approve itself\n- Creates audit trail\n\n### 3. Compliance Receipts\nEvery campaign generates an immutable compliance receipt:\n- Gate 1 results (rules checked)\n- Gate 2 results (AI scores)\n- Gate 3 results (who approved, when)\n- SHA-256 hash for tamper-proof verification\n- Downloadable as PDF or JSON\n\n### 4. Feedback Loop (\"What Changed Since Last Time\")\nThe system learns and adapts:\n- Remembers past campaign performance\n- Shows adjustments made based on data\n- Example adjustments:\n  - \"Excluded customers with unresolved negative reviews\" (73% lower conversion)\n  - \"Increased wait time from 2 to 5 days\" (45% lower open rates when contacted too soon)\n  - \"Prioritized referral over discount offers\" (VIP customers respond 2.3x better)\n\n### 5. Brand Voice Enforcement\n- Learns brand voice from uploaded documents\n- Calculates brand alignment score (0-100%)\n- Ensures consistent messaging across all channels\n- Premier Nissan voice: Professional, Trustworthy, Community-focused\n\n---\n\n",

      "content": "## General Questions\n\n### What can TrustEye do?\nTrustEye can create three types of marketing campaigns from your real Birdeye data:\n1. **Referral campaigns** from 5-star reviews - identify happy customers and ask for referrals\n2. **Conquest campaigns** based on competitor weaknesses - target customers unhappy with competitors like Valley Honda\n3. **Recovery campaigns** from negative reviews - immediately reach out to unhappy customers\n\nAll campaigns go through 3-gate approval (Rules, AI, Human) before sending. The system learns from past performance and shows you \"what changed since last time.\"\n\nWant me to create one of these campaigns?\n\n### How is TrustEye different from Jasper?\nJasper has what they call a \"Trust Foundation\" - infrastructure underneath their tools. It's a promise.\n\nTrustEye has a \"Trust Layer\" - verification that's visible, auditable, and defensible. It's evidence.\n\n**Jasper says \"trust us.\" TrustEye says \"here's the proof.\"**\n\nEvery campaign in TrustEye generates a compliance receipt with:\n- What rules were checked\n- AI review scores\n- Who approved it and when\n- SHA-256 hash (tamper-proof)\n\nWhen regulators ask \"prove this campaign was compliant\" - you hand them the receipt.\n\n### What integrations exist?\nTrustEye integrates with:\n- **Birdeye** - Customer reviews, contacts, competitor data\n- **Slack** - Team notifications and approval workflow\n- **Resend** - Email delivery (with in10.ai domain)\n- **Late.dev** - Social media posting to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn\n- **Supabase** - Database for campaigns, audiences, and receipts\n\n### What is the 3-gate approval system?\nEvery campaign goes through 3 gates before sending:\n\n**Gate 1: Rules Engine** (Automated)\n- CAN-SPAM, GDPR compliance\n- Profanity filter, PII detection\n- Required fields check\n- Binary: Pass or Fail\n\n**Gate 2: AI Review** (Automated)\n- Brand score (target 85%+)\n- Toxicity check (target 0%)\n- Copyright risk assessment\n- Probabilistic scoring\n\n**Gate 3: Human Approval** (Manual)\n- Slack notification with Approve/Reject\n- Records who approved, when, how long they reviewed\n- Non-negotiable: AI cannot approve itself\n\n### How does brand voice work?\nTrustEye learns your brand voice from uploaded documents:\n1. Upload brand guidelines, past campaigns, style guides\n2. TrustEye indexes and learns the patterns\n3. When generating content, it scores against your brand voice\n4. Brand Score shows alignment (0-100%)\n\nFor Premier Nissan, the voice is:\n- Professional yet friendly\n- Trustworthy and transparent\n- Community-focused\n- Value-conscious (not cheap)\n\n---\n\n",

Find customers who left 5-star reviews recently\n2. Generate a personalized thank-you email\n3. Include a referral ask with reciprocal benefit\n4. Send through 3-gate approval\n\nBest practice: Send within 48 hours of the review for best response.\n\n### How do I create a conquest campaign?\nSay: \"Create a conquest campaign targeting Valley Honda customers\"\n\nTrustEye will:\n1. Analyze Valley Honda's weaknesses from competitor data\n2. Identify their pain points (slow service, hidden fees)\n3. Create content highlighting our strengths\n4. Target relevant audience segments\n\n### How do I create a recovery campaign?\nSay: \"Create a recovery campaign for negative reviews\"\n\nTrustEye will:\n1. Find customers with 1-2 star reviews\n2. Create personalized recovery outreach\n3. Include appropriate offer (20% is optimal for win-back)\n4. Route for immediate human approval\n\nBest practice: Respond within 2 hours of negative review.\n\n---\n\n",

      "content": "## Technical Questions\n\n### What guardrails does TrustEye check?\nTrustEye runs 17 guardrails including:\n- No hate speech\n- No profanity\n- Brand name present\n- Unsubscribe link included\n- No competitor mentions\n- No PII exposed\n- Appropriate tone\n- Required legal elements\n\n### How does the feedback loop work?\nTrustEye shows \"What changed since last time\" - adjustments made based on past performance:\n\nExample adjustments:\n- \"Excluded customers with unresolved negative reviews\" (73% lower conversion)\n- \"Increased wait time from 2 to 5 days\" (45% better open rates)\n- \"Prioritized referral over discount\" (VIP responds 2.3x better)\n\nThis demonstrates the system has:\n- **Memory** - remembers past results\n- **Causality** - understands why things worked\n- **Adaptation** - changes behavior automatically\n- **Control** - shows you what changed\n\n### Can AI approve campaigns by itself?\nNo. Gate 3 (Human Approval) is non-delegable. The system verifies:\n- Click came from a human\n- Interaction duration (not instant)\n- Session verification\n- Identity validation\n\nAI cannot bypass this gate. Every approval creates an audit trail.\n",
